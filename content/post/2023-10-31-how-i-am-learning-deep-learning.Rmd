### Step 1, get a high-level understanding 

* Watch [statquest](https://statquest.org/) by Josh Starmer.

```{r echo=FALSE}
library("vembedr")

```


* 1blue3brown deep learning playlist

```{r echo=FALSE}
library("vembedr")

embed_url("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk")
```

### Step2, code it out!

If you are into `python`, watch "The spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation: building micrograd":

```{r echo=FALSE}
library("vembedr")

embed_url("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0")
```

I still code in `R` for most of the time, so I walk through the R code in the [deep learning with R](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-r) book. It is pretty accessible. I then go through the examples and write blog posts on it.

See my posts:

* [Basic tensor/array manipulations in R](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com/post/basic-tensor-array-manipulations-in-r/)

* [Deep learning with Keras using MNIST dataset](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com/post/deep-learning-with-keras-using-mnst-dataset/)

* [How to code a variational autoencoder (VAE) in R using the MNIST dataset](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com/post/how-to-code-a-variational-autoencoder-vae-in-r-using-mnist-dataset/)


### Step 3, apply it to real biological examples 

The examples in the books are usually not biological data, either it is movie review or MNIST image classification etc. To understand how deep learning is applied to biological data, read

Books: 

* [deep learning for genomics](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Genomics-applications-biotechnology/dp/1804615447/) 

* [deep learning for the life sciences](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Life-Sciences-Microscopy/dp/1492039837/)

Blog posts:

* [How to represent a protein sequence](https://liambai.com/protein-representation/)

* [Where is generative design in drug discovery today?](https://medium.com/@leowossnig/where-is-generative-design-in-drug-discovery-today-7234945177cf)

More papers I collected can be found at https://github.com/crazyhottommy/Machine_learning_drug_discovery

I then apply it to a biological problem using biological datasets.
 
See my blog posts:

* [Deep learning to predict cancer from healthy controls using TCRseq data](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com/post/deep-learning-to-predict-cancer-from-healthy-controls-using-tcrseq-data/)

* [How to use 1d convolutional neural network (conv1d) to predict DNA sequence binding to protein](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com/post/how-to-use-1d-convolutional-neural-network-conv1d-to-predict-dna-sequence-binding-to-protein/)

* [Predict TCR cancer specificity using 1d convolutional and LSTM neural networks](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com/post/predict-tcr-cancer-specificity-using-1d-convolutional-and-lstm-neural-networks/)

### Step 4, apply the learning to a real project

At immunitas, we are really interested in the TCR-seq data. Matthew Bernstein and I are working on a deep learning project. More to come!

### Conclusions

* Deep learning can be daunting if you just started. For me, it is good enough to understand at a high level, what hyperparameters can be tuned, understand when to use which model, and aware of its strength and limitations.
