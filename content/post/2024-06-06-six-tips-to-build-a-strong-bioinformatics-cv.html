<p>If you apply for a Bioinformatics position, hundreds of CVs get to sent to the hiring manager.
How to stand out among all of them? Below are 6 tips from my hiring experience:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Include a GitHub Link: Ensure your CV has a GitHub link with relevant content like Python or R packages, data analysis projects, or replicated figures from published papers. Regularly commit to demonstrate consistent coding activity. <strong>You will not get into the next round of interview if you
do not have a github link</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Organize and Document Projects: Structure your GitHub repositories with consistent folder structures (e.g., data, scripts, results) and comprehensive documentation for readability and future reference. I care about reproducibility and good documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a Personal Website: Build a personal website to showcase additional materials not typically included in a CV, such as talks, posters, and blog posts that demonstrate your computational skills and problem-solving capabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Blogging: Use the blog section of your website to write about problem-solving experiences, demonstrating your expertise in R or Python. This can be more impactful than just listing skills on your CV.</p></li>
<li><p>Use Tools like ‘blogdown’: For those using R, the ‘blogdown’ package can help create a professional-looking website where R or Python code can be rendered into HTML.</p></li>
<li><p>Start Early: Building a strong GitHub profile and personal website takes time. Begin these efforts as early as possible to gradually develop a robust and impressive online presence. As I awalys say: The best time to start was 10 years ago, the second best time is right now!</p></li>
