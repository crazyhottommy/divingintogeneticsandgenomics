<p>My regret is not learning linear algebra well during college.</p>
<p>I barely passed the exam for it (and calculus, it was a nightmare :) ).</p>
<p>To be fair..</p>
<p>It was not taught well and it sounded too boring. I did not know what the application of matrix multiplication was, not until…</p>
<p>Many years later, I started to learn bioinformatics. I find many data are just data matrices:</p>
<ul>
<li>an RNAseq expression matrix is a gene-by-sample matrix, with entries to be read counts for each gene</li>
<li>a single-cell expression matrix is a gene-by-cell matrix, with entries to be read counts for each gene</li>
<li>a ChIP-seq count matrix is a peak-by-sample matrix, with entries to be the number of reads in each peak</li>
<li>a drug response matrix is a drug-by-sample matrix, with entries to be IC50 for example</li>
</ul>
<p>and many more… in other words,</p>
<p><strong>Matrix is EVERYWHERE for bioinformatics (and many other data science topics)!</strong></p>
<p>Read this blog post on <a href="https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com/post/matrix-factorization-for-single-cell-rnaseq-data/">Matrix factorization on single-cell RNAseq data</a> to see how useful it is!</p>
<p>I have written two <a href="https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com/post/cca-alignment/">blog posts</a> on how Seurat PCA projection/CCA alignment and label transfer work for single-cell RNAseq data in low-level details.</p>
<p>Man, it was hard. I spent 8 hours for each post spanning serveral nights. But I enjoyed it as I also learned the topic deeper.</p>
<p>During the writing of the posts, I really wished I learned linear algebra better during college:) but it is never too late to learn. You can take MIT1806, which is a great course for linear algebra.</p>
<p>And I am re-watching <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/eigenvalues">eigenvalues and eigenvectors from 3blue1brown</a>.</p>
<p>What’s your regret?</p>
<p>Happy Learning!</p>
