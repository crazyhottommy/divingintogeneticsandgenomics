<p>As 2024 wraps up, it’s the perfect time to reflect and prepare for the new year.
I wrote the review for 2023 <a href="https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com/post/review-2023/">here</a>.</p>
<div id="goals-reached" class="section level3">
<h3>Goals reached</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>✅ I lost 12 lb in 6 weeks!</p></li>
<li><p>✅ Supported the clinical trial to identify bio markers for potential responders to our drug at Immunitas. Helped with indication selection for the second and third program. I moved to Astrazeneca in August. I really appreciate my experience at Immunitas and learned a lot. Now I want to learn more at AstraZeneca!</p></li>
<li><p>✅ Go to one conference that is not local. (I am spoiled to attend many conferences in Boston last year). I went to EMBL for <a href="https://biont-training.eu/CarpentryConnect2024.html" class="uri">https://biont-training.eu/CarpentryConnect2024.html</a> conference at Heidelberg, Germany. This is my first time traveling to Europe. Thanks again for the invitation!</p></li>
<li><p>❌ I did not Host another AI for drug discovery conference in 2024. I co-organized this one in 2023.</p></li>
<li><p>❌ I did not Finish this deep learning course <a href="https://course.fast.ai/" class="uri">https://course.fast.ai/</a>. This will be in 2025.</p></li>
<li><p>✅ Take one more leadership training session. I took a <a href="https://www.red10dev.com/">Red10 leadership session</a> for influence at AstraZeneca. It is a great program and I will post some notes on Saturdays.</p></li>
<li><p>✅ Make at least one video a week; one blog post/tutorial (42 posts in 2024)every two weeks. 7.5K subscribers after 1.5 years! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@chatomics/videos" class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/@chatomics/videos</a></p></li>
<li><p>✅ Post every day on Linkedin pre-scheduled with <a href="http://buffer.com" class="uri">http://buffer.com</a></p></li>
<li><p>✅ Write 500 words every day. (either my learning from podcasts on my commute or any reading)</p></li>
<li><p>✅ Read at least 12 books again! Some of them:</p></li>

<h3>Goals in 2025</h3>
<p>New Year’s resolutions are popular, but how much have you achieved? Consistency is the key.</p>
<p>Consistency transforms actions into results.</p>
<p>When you prioritize your most important goal, break it down into daily tasks. Those consistent days turn into consistent weeks…</p>
<p>Consistent weeks lead to consistent months.</p>
<p>And consistent months create consistent years.</p>
<p>All of that builds an epic life.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For me, my technical skill goal is to finish the deep learning course on Fast.ai <a href="https://course.fast.ai/" class="uri">https://course.fast.ai/</a>. It was on my to-do last year, but I didn’t finish. Failure isn’t scary—it’s a chance to learn and keep moving forward.</p></li>
<li><p>My goal for LinkedIn? Post long, high-quality content every day.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I batch schedule posts on Sundays:</p>
<p>• Mon-Fri/Sunday: Bioinformatics (technical)</p>
<p>• Sat: Leadership &amp; management &amp; life lessons</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For self-improvement, I keep a daily reflection diary.It’s been 2 years, and my goal is to continue this habit every day. It helps me grow.</p></li>
<li><p>In management, my focus is building trust with my team. I aim to support their growth—both technically and with soft skills.</p></li>
<li><p>At work, my single goal is to deliver portfolio support analysis on time and consistently drive the project to have novel biological insights.</p></li>
<li><p>Read another 12 books!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I wish you all a prosperous 2025!</p>
