I gave a guest lecture on single cell ATACseq for [STAT115](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/49497/assignments/syllabus) to the Harvard students. The videos can be found at https://liulab-dfci.github.io/bioinfo-combio/scatac.html. slides can be found in the PDF as well. Shirley has put all her course videos in the above bookdown. Great resource for Bioinformatics!
