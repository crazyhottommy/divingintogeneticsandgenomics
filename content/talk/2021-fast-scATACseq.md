I am invited by Henry Rong in [Center for Functional Cancer Epigenomics](http://cfce.dfci.harvard.edu/) (CFCE)  at Dana-Farber to give a presentation on [Fast analysis of scATAC-seq data using a predefined set of genomic regions](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.rbind.io/publication/2020-03-20-kallisto-scatac/). This project was a enjoyable collabration with [Davide Cittaro](https://research.hsr.it/en/centers/omics-sciences/innovation-lab/davide-cittaro.html) at San Raffaele Scientific Institute in Italy.
