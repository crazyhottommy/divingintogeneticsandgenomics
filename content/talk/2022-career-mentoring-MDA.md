I shared my career path at a Career mentoring session for Department of Genomic Medicine, MD Anderson Cancer Center. I had the pleasure to see many old colleagues and mentors [Dr.Andrew Futreal](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/andrew_futreal.html) and [Dr.Jianjun (Jay) Zhang](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/jianjun_zhang.html).
