In this episode of "Navigating Omics Data Analysis Challenges in Biotech", we have the pleasure of interviewing ðŸŽ¯ Ming "Tommy" Tang, the Director of Computational Biology at Immunitas Therapeutics.

Tommy is widely recognized for his invaluable contributions to the bioinformatics community and his expertise in machine learning, dedication to open science, and commitment to empowering biologists with essential computational skills.

During this interview, we'll deep dive into his extensive experience in the field, with a special focus on the challenges in omics data analysis and potential solutions. Weâ€™ll be discussing:

âž¡ The challenges that bioinformaticians and biologists encounter in omics data analysis.  
âž¡ The outlook for the field of bioinformatics.  
âž¡ The role of AI in omics data analysis.
