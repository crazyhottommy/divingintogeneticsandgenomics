How has computational biology impacted the field of immuno-oncology?

This was the question we wanted to explore with üéØ Ming "Tommy" Tang in the latest episode of Data in Biotech.

Over this fascinating deep-dive interview with the Director of Computational Biology at Immunitas Therapeutics, we covered everything from:

‚òÅ The scalability of the cloud and its impact on improving biotech data

üåÄ Keeping data in-house vs. big data warehouses (and the overall messiness of public data)

üìä And the role of machine learning in computational biology
