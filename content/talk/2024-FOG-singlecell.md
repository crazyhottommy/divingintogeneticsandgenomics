The Single Cell Track begins with sessions on 'Improving Your Understanding of Disease Complexity' with Saurabh Vishnu Laddha and a panel on 'Navigating the Crossroads of Single Cell Genomics and Human Genetics' with Joseph Powell, Marisol Alvarez-Martinez, PhD, Fan Zhang, PhD and Giorgio Gaglia

Occurring in parallel on the Spatial Omics Track, we have two sessions on multimodal spatial methods, including proteomics and transcriptomics and mass spec imaging, featuring Tullia Bruno and Elizabeth Neumann

Afterwards, on the Single Cell Track, we have session on mastering sample preparation for single cell, led by Ashleigh Lister and Kristin Beaumont, covering all manner of problems related to single cell, nuclei and tough tissues.

The Spatial Omics Track then features two sessions on 'Defining Cellular Populations, Dynamics and Interactions' with Miao-Ping Chien and Gregory Schwartz. Learn about new methods for cell-cell communication and linking genotype to phenotype.

Finally, the Single Cell Track closes with sessions on data analysis, with revolutionary sessions on AI with Yann Abraham and Jun Ding, finishing with the Big Challenge Session on data analysis led by ðŸŽ¯ **Ming "Tommy" Tang**.
