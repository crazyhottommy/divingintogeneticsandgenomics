Your journey in the field of computational biology is inspiring and we hope through the webinar ISCB RSG India would be able to bring your story firsthand to the  budding computational biologists. We trust that they will not only gain academic insights from your talk but would also be able to find the right motivation to carve their own path in this constantly evolving field. 
As we can see from your profile, you have a diverse skill set and experience of both academia and industry.

We request you to talk a bit about your research work, challenges faced in taking up and pursuing Bioinformatics, trials and successes over the journey besides the specific domain you wish to touch upon. Please also talk about your entrepreneurial journey as it will be inspiring for freshly graduating research scholars and students.
