With a theme of 'From Code to Cure Bridging the Gap in Biological Sciences,' the cooperative efforts of the Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences Graduate Programs have culminated in organizing The 2nd Annual Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences Symposium - 2024(IBSS). The goal of IBSS 2024 is to unite scholars from diverse biological domains to deliver advances in the relevant fields and to promote an atmosphere to facilitate the exchange of idIBSS Flyereas and information. The symposium will feature keynote speakers who are experts in their fields. It will also provide exceptional opportunities for all participants to share their research through oral presentations and poster sessions. The participants will form new collaborations in this two-day symposium to advance innovative scientific research.
