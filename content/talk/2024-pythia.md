Say hi to 2024 with the first webinar in our "Omics Connect" series!

Integration of data from different experimental batches is one of the most crucial yet challenging steps in single-cell data analysis workflows. In this webinar, we are honored to invite Dr. ðŸŽ¯ Ming "Tommy" Tang, Director of Computational Biology at Immunitas Therapeutics, to discuss the latest methods and challenges of single-cell RNA-seq integration.

You will also learn from Jenny Pham, Head of Scientific Marketing and Training Programs at Pythia Biosciences, about the single-cell analysis workflows supported in Pythia's CDIAM Multi-Omics Platform through which you can integrate scRNA-seq data with other types of omics for aggregate insights.
