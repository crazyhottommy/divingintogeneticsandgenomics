      <description>There are so many public datasets there waiting for us to mine! It is the blessing and cursing as a computational biologist!
Metadata, or the data describing (e.g., responder or non-responder for the treatment) the data are critical in interpreting the analysis. Without metadata, your data are useless.
People usually go to GEO or ENA to download public data. I asked this question on twitter, and I will show you how to get the metadata as suggested by all the awesome tweeps.</description>

      <title>Be careful when left_join tables with duplicated rows</title>

      <guid>/post/be-careful-when-left-join-tables-with-duplicated-rows/</guid>
      <description>This is going to be a really short blog post. I recently found that if I join two tables with one of the tables having duplicated rows, the final joined table also contains the duplicated rows. It could be the expected behavior for others but I want to make a note here for myself.
library(tidyverse) df1&amp;lt;- tibble(key = c(&amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;D&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;E&amp;quot;), value = 1:5) df1 ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## key value ## &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;int&amp;gt; ## 1 A 1 ## 2 B 2 ## 3 C 3 ## 4 D 4 ## 5 E 5 dataframe 2 has two identical rows for B.</description>

      <description>I am interested in learning more on matrix factorization and its application in scRNAseq data. I want to shout out to this paper: Enter the Matrix: Factorization Uncovers Knowledge from Omics by Elana J. Fertig group.
A matrix is decomposed to two matrices: the amplitude matrix and the pattern matrix. You can then do all sorts of things with the decomposed matrices. Single cell matrix is no special, one can use the matrix factorization techniques to derive interesting biological insights.</description>

      <description>I asked this question on Twitter:
 what test to test if two distributions are different? I am aware of KS test. When n is large (which is common in genomic studies), the p-value is always significant. better to test against an effect size? how to do it in this context?
 In genomics studies, it is very common to have large N (e.g., the number of introns, promoters in the genome, number of cells in the single-cell studies).</description>

      <description>Dotplot is a nice way to visualize scRNAseq expression data across clusters. It gives information (by color) for the average expression level across cells within the cluster and the percentage (by size of the dot) of the cells express that gene within the cluster.
Seurat has a nice function for that. However, it can not do the clustering for the rows and columns. David McGaughey has written a blog post using ggplot2 and ggtree from Guangchuang Yu.</description>

      <description>It is the end of the year again and it is a good time to review my 2020. I wrote one for 2019. It has been a tough year for many of us. It is the same for me. I switched my job from Harvard FAS informatics to Department of Data Science at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute during the shutdown because of COVID19 at the end of March and has been working from home since then.</description>

      <description>When it comes to make a heatmap, ComplexHeatmap by Zuguang Gu is my favorite. Check it out! You will be amazed on how flexible it is and the documentation is in top niche.
For Single-cell RNAseq, Seurat provides a DoHeatmap function using ggplot2. There are two limitations:
 when your genes are not in the top variable gene list, the scale.data will not have that gene and DoHeatmap will drop those genes.</description>

      <description>It is very common to see in the scRNAseq papers that the authors compare cell type abundance across groups (e.g., treatment vs control, responder vs non-responder).
Let’s create some dummy data.

      <description>I wanted to set up Travis CI long time ago. Finally, I have a chance to do so. There are already many posts on how to do it. I write it down here for my own future reference. Thanks Tao Liu for the instructions. I have been learning a lot from him in collabrating with the MAESTRO project.

      <description>I was using the tidyverse rocker image on HPC by singularity pull. see my previous post.
Everything was OK until I encountered problems installing jpeg and Cairo R packages. Later, I also had an error installing scRepertoire dependency gsl.
It turns out I have to install debian packages inside the container:
$ apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt install -y --no-install-recommends libjpeg62-turbo-dev zlib1g-dev libpng-dev \ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt install -y --no-install-recommends libx11-dev libcairo2-dev libxt-dev \ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt install -y libgsl-dev  However, singularity file system is read-only.</description>

      <description>Seurat is great for scRNAseq analysis and it provides many easy-to-use ggplot2 wrappers for visualization. However, this brings the cost of flexibility. For example, In FeaturePlot, one can specify multiple genes and also split.by to further split to multiple the conditions in the meta.data. If split.by is not NULL, the ncol is ignored so you can not arrange the grid.
This is best to understand with an example.

      <description>In my last post, I tried to include transgenes to the cellranger reference and want to get the counts for the transgenes. However, even after I extended the Tdtomato and Cre with the potential 3’UTR, I still get very few cells express them. This is confusing to me.
My next thought is: maybe the STAR aligner is doing something weird that excluded those reads? At this point, I want to give kb-python, a python wrapper on kallisto and bustools a try.</description>

      <description>In a typical “barnyard” experiment in which cells from different species are mixed before loading to the 10x controller, the identification of the species of origin after mapping/counting with the hybrid reference is a problem. People tend to use the ratio of reads mapped to each reference genome to determine which species a cell is from.
In this paper https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/630087v1.full
 To deconvolute species, detect doublets and low quality cells, the mixed-species mapped data was used.</description>

      <description>TSS enrichment score serves as an important quality control metric for ATACseq data. I want to write a script for single cell ATACseq data.
From the Encode page:
 Transcription Start Site (TSS) Enrichment Score - The TSS enrichment calculation is a signal to noise calculation. The reads around a reference set of TSSs are collected to form an aggregate distribution of reads centered on the TSSs and extending to 1000 bp in either direction (for a total of 2000bp).</description>

      <description>scATACseq data are very sparse. It is sparser than scRNAseq. To do clustering of scATACseq data, there are some preprocessing steps need to be done.
I want to reproduce what has been done after reading the method section of these two recent scATACseq paper:
A Single-Cell Atlas of In Vivo Mammalian Chromatin Accessibility Darren et.al Cell 2018   Latent Semantic Indexing Cluster Analysis  In order to get an initial sense of the relationship between individual cells, we first broke the genome into 5kb windows and then scored each cell for any insertions in these windows, generating a large, sparse, binary matrix of 5kb windows by cells for each tissue.</description>

      <description>I need a transcript to gene mapping file for Salmon. I am aware of annotation bioconductor packages that can do this job. However, I was working on a species which does not have the annotation in a package format (I am going to use Drosphila as an example for this blog post). I had to go and got the gtf file and made such a file from scratch.
Please read the specifications of those two file formats.</description>
