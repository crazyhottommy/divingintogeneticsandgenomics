      <description>Background Please read the following before go ahead:
 what is docker?
 what is Rocker?
 what is singularity?
  from Harvard Research computing website: Odyssey has singularity installed.
 Why Singularity? There are some important differences between Docker and Singularity:
  Docker and Singularity have their own container formats. Docker containers may be imported to run via Singularity. Docker containers need root privileges for full functionality which is not suitable for a shared HPC environment.</description>

      <description>I am still suck at vim or emacs. I use nano to edit files on remote machines. But for more complicated editing, I prefer to use sublime.
use this https://github.com/randy3k/RemoteSubl for editing remote files.
Steps:
on remote machine, install rmate ssh bio1 curl -o ~/bin/rmate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aurora/rmate/master/rmate chmod u+x bin/rmate  on your local computer, install RemoteSubl on your local computer, open sublime, click tools &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Command Palette &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; type Package control:Install Package &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; type RemoteSubl to install.</description>

      <description>dot files Those files are originally got from Samir Amin, my labmate in Roel Verhaak&amp;rsquo;s lab. Thanks for sharing!
.screenrc
.bashrc
.bash_profile
and inside .profile.d folder, there is a file named 01_odyssey_config.sh. It was executed when you login the shell.
You can grab my dot files in my github repo.
Inside the .bash_profile:
if [ -d $HOME/.profile.d ]; then for i in $HOME/.profile.d/*.sh; do if [ -r $i ]; then if [ &amp;quot;${-#*i}&amp;quot; !</description>

      <description>request an account following here.
 Harvard odyssey HPC requires a two-factor security login. First set up the VPN following here
 Then read about OpenAuth here. One can download mobile apps such as Duo and google-Authenticator on your phone, but then each time you will need to type the password to the terminal. Or you can download the java program for desktop, if you have a FAS research computing account, you should be able to download it from the link FASRC send you.</description>
