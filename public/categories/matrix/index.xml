My regret is not learning linear algebra well during college.
I barely passed the exam for it (and calculus, it was a nightmare :) ).
To be fair..
It was not taught well and it sounded too boring. I did not know what the application of matrix multiplication was, not untilâ€¦
Many years later, I started to learn bioinformatics.</description>
