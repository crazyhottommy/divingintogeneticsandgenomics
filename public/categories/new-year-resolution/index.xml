      <description>By the end of every year, I write a review of the past year. It is a great time to reflect on the Losses and Wins and plan for the new year. I can not believe 2024 is right at the corner. My review of 2022 can be found at https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com/post/review-2022/.
Goals reached for 2023 This is in the same order of the goals of 2023 in my last yearâ€™s review.</description>
