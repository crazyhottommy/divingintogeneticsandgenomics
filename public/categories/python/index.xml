      <description>There was a paper on this topic: A New Online Computational Biology Curriculum.
I am going to provide a biased list below (I have read most of the books if not all). I say it is biased because you will see many books of R are from Hadely Wickham. I now use tidyverse most of the time.
Unix I suggest people who want to learn bioinformatics starting to learn unix commands first.</description>

      <description>I want to split the PBMC scATAC bam from 10x by cluster id. So, I can then make a bigwig for each cluster to visualize in IGV.
The first thing I did was googling to see if anyone has written such a tool (Do not reinvent the wheels!). People have done that because I saw figures from the scATAC papers. I just could not find it. Maybe I need to refine my googling skills.</description>
