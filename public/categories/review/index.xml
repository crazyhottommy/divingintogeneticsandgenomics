      <title>Biotech Data Strategy: Building a Scalable Foundation for Startups</title>

      <description>In a biotech startup, an early data strategy is key to ensure public and private data remain useful and valuable. As AI hype reaches new heights, I want to emphasize that a data strategy must precede any AI strategy.
Data is the oil of the AI engine. Unfortunately, the real-world data are usually messy and not AI-ready. Without a robust data strategy, you are building an AI system on a shaky foundation.</description>

      <description>As 2024 wraps up, it’s the perfect time to reflect and prepare for the new year. I wrote the review for 2023 here.
Goals reached ✅ I lost 12 lb in 6 weeks!
 ✅ Supported the clinical trial to identify bio markers for potential responders to our drug at Immunitas. Helped with indication selection for the second and third program. I moved to Astrazeneca in August. I really appreciate my experience at Immunitas and learned a lot.</description>

      <description>Every year, I write a review for the past 12 months. Find my review for 2021.
Some top wins:  Anna was born in September! It is a lot of work with three kids, but they are cute!
 I am grateful for our CSO Thomas Tan, who has confidence in me to lead the team. We built an amazing computational biology team at Immunitas. I am so fortunate to have Matt, Tim and Michelle in the group.</description>

      <description>It is almost the end of 2018. It is a good time to review what I have achieved during the year and look forward to a brand new 2019. I wrote a similar post for 2017 here.
Some highlights of the year 2018:  My son Noah Tang was born in April. He is so lovely and we love him so much. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe he is almost 9 months old.</description>
