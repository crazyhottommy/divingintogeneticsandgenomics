      <description>Every year, I write a review for the past 12 months. Find my review for 2021.
Some top wins:  Anna was born in September! It is a lot of work with three kids, but they are cute!
 I am grateful for our CSO Thomas Tan, who has confidence in me to lead the team. We built an amazing computational biology team at Immunitas. I am so fortunate to have Matt, Tim and Michelle in the group.</description>

      <description>It is almost the end of 2018. It is a good time to review what I have achieved during the year and look forward to a brand new 2019. I wrote a similar post for 2017 here.
Some highlights of the year 2018:  My son Noah Tang was born in April. He is so lovely and we love him so much. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe he is almost 9 months old.</description>
