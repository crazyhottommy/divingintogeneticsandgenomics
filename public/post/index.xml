      <title>clustered dotplot for single-cell RNAseq</title>

      <description>Dotplot is a nice way to visualize scRNAseq expression data across clusters. It gives information (by color) for the average expression level across cells within the cluster and the percentage (by size of the dot) of the cells express that gene within the cluster.
Seurat has a nice function for that. However, it can not do the clustering for the rows and columns. David McGaughey has written a blog post using ggplot2 and ggtree from Guangchuang Yu.</description>

      <description>I never have thought that my first blog post in 2021 would be non-technical. I shared this personal story on LinkedIn and want to make it a blog post.
I want to share how our beings are shaped by our life experiences. Let me take myself as an example. I grew up in a low-income family in China, but I inherited tremendous riches from my Mom in terms of precious characters.</description>

      <description>It is the end of the year again and it is a good time to review my 2020. I wrote one for 2019. It has been a tough year for many of us. It is the same for me. I switched my job from Harvard FAS informatics to Department of Data Science at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute during the shutdown because of COVID19 at the end of March and has been working from home since then.</description>

      <description>When it comes to make a heatmap, ComplexHeatmap by Zuguang Gu is my favorite. Check it out! You will be amazed on how flexible it is and the documentation is in top niche.
For Single-cell RNAseq, Seurat provides a DoHeatmap function using ggplot2. There are two limitations:
 when your genes are not in the top variable gene list, the scale.data will not have that gene and DoHeatmap will drop those genes.</description>

      <description>It is very common to see in the scRNAseq papers that the authors compare cell type abundance across groups (e.g., treatment vs control, responder vs non-responder).
Let’s create some dummy data.

      <description>I wanted to set up Travis CI long time ago. Finally, I have a chance to do so. There are already many posts on how to do it. I write it down here for my own future reference. Thanks Tao Liu for the instructions. I have been learning a lot from him in collabrating with the MAESTRO project.

      <description>I was using the tidyverse rocker image on HPC by singularity pull. see my previous post.
Everything was OK until I encountered problems installing jpeg and Cairo R packages. Later, I also had an error installing scRepertoire dependency gsl.
It turns out I have to install debian packages inside the container:
$ apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt install -y --no-install-recommends libjpeg62-turbo-dev zlib1g-dev libpng-dev \ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt install -y --no-install-recommends libx11-dev libcairo2-dev libxt-dev \ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apt install -y libgsl-dev  However, singularity file system is read-only.</description>

      <description>Seurat is great for scRNAseq analysis and it provides many easy-to-use ggplot2 wrappers for visualization. However, this brings the cost of flexibility. For example, In FeaturePlot, one can specify multiple genes and also split.by to further split to multiple the conditions in the meta.data. If split.by is not NULL, the ncol is ignored so you can not arrange the grid.
This is best to understand with an example.

      <title>stacked violin plot for visualizing single-cell data in Seurat</title>

      <guid>/post/stacked-violin-plot-for-visualizing-single-cell-data-in-seurat/</guid>
      <description>In scanpy, there is a function to create a stacked violin plot.
There is no such function in Seurat, and many people were asking for this feature. e.g. https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/issues/300
https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/issues/463
The developers have not implemented this feature yet. In this post, I am trying to make a stacked violin plot in Seurat.
The idea is to create a violin plot per gene using the VlnPlot in Seurat, then customize the axis text/tick and reduce the margin for each plot and finally concatenate by cowplot::plot_grid or patchwork::wrap_plots.</description>

      <description>I am taking this STATE-80 course from Harvard Extension School. This course teaches commonly used distributions and probability theory. The instructor Hatch is a really good teacher and he uses simulation for all the demonstrations along with the formulas.
In week 6, we revisited the Monty Hall problem which we played on the first day of class.
If you have not heard about it, I quoted from the wiki:

      <description>In my last post, I tried to include transgenes to the cellranger reference and want to get the counts for the transgenes. However, even after I extended the Tdtomato and Cre with the potential 3’UTR, I still get very few cells express them. This is confusing to me.
My next thought is: maybe the STAR aligner is doing something weird that excluded those reads? At this point, I want to give kb-python, a python wrapper on kallisto and bustools a try.</description>

      <description>In a typical “barnyard” experiment in which cells from different species are mixed before loading to the 10x controller, the identification of the species of origin after mapping/counting with the hybrid reference is a problem. People tend to use the ratio of reads mapped to each reference genome to determine which species a cell is from.

 To deconvolute species, detect doublets and low quality cells, the mixed-species mapped data was used.</description>

      <description>This post is inspired by two posts written by Valentine Svensson:

http://www.nxn.se/valent/2018/1/30/count-depth-variation-makes-Poisson-scrna-seq-data-negative-binomial
The original ipython notebook can be found at https://github.com/vals/Blog/blob/master/171116-zero-inflation/Negative%20control%20analysis.ipynb
Thanks for writing those and put both the data and code in public. After I read Droplet scRNA-seq is not zero-inflated by Valentine Svensson, I want to gain some understanding of it. This post is an effort to replicate some of the analysis in the preprint using R. The original analysis was carried out in python.</description>

      <description>“Every model is wrong, but some are useful”— George Box
In an effort to better understand the distribution of single-cell RNAseq counts, I dived a bit deeper into the negative binomial distribution in the context of R. I am by no means an expert in statistics and writing this post is for myself to better understand it.
what is a negative binomial distribution I will quote from wiki:

I am going to provide a biased list below (I have read most of the books if not all). I say it is biased because you will see many books of R are from Hadely Wickham. I now use tidyverse most of the time.

      <description>Background Please read the following before go ahead:
 what is docker?
 what is Rocker?
 what is singularity?
  from Harvard Research computing website: Odyssey has singularity installed.
 Why Singularity? There are some important differences between Docker and Singularity:
  Docker and Singularity have their own container formats. Docker containers may be imported to run via Singularity. Docker containers need root privileges for full functionality which is not suitable for a shared HPC environment.</description>

      <description>TSS enrichment score serves as an important quality control metric for ATACseq data. I want to write a script for single cell ATACseq data.
From the Encode page:
 Transcription Start Site (TSS) Enrichment Score - The TSS enrichment calculation is a signal to noise calculation. The reads around a reference set of TSSs are collected to form an aggregate distribution of reads centered on the TSSs and extending to 1000 bp in either direction (for a total of 2000bp).</description>

      <description>scATACseq data are very sparse. It is sparser than scRNAseq. To do clustering of scATACseq data, there are some preprocessing steps need to be done.
I want to reproduce what has been done after reading the method section of these two recent scATACseq paper:
A Single-Cell Atlas of In Vivo Mammalian Chromatin Accessibility Darren et.al Cell 2018   Latent Semantic Indexing Cluster Analysis  In order to get an initial sense of the relationship between individual cells, we first broke the genome into 5kb windows and then scored each cell for any insertions in these windows, generating a large, sparse, binary matrix of 5kb windows by cells for each tissue.</description>

I then (re)discovered this awesome docopt.R. One just needs to write the help message the you want to display and docopt() will parse the options, arguments and return a named list which can be accessed inside the R script. check http://docopt.org/ for more information as well.</description>

The first thing I did was googling to see if anyone has written such a tool (Do not reinvent the wheels!). People have done that because I saw figures from the scATAC papers. I just could not find it. Maybe I need to refine my googling skills.</description>

However, I was working on a species which does not have the annotation in a package format (I am going to use Drosphila as an example for this blog post). I had to go and got the gtf file and made such a file from scratch.
Please read the specifications of those two file formats.</description>

      <description>PCA is a critical method for dimension reduction for high-dimensional data. High-dimensional data are data with features (p) a lot more than observations (n). However, this is changing with single-cell RNAseq data. Now, we can sequence millions (n) of single cells and each cell has ~20,000 genes/features (p).
I suggest you read my previous blog post on using svd to calculate PCs.
Single-cell expression data PCA In single-cell RNAseq analysis, feature selection will be performed first.</description>

      <description>PCA in practice. Principal Component Analysis(PCA) is a very important skill for dimention reduction to analyze high-dimentional data. High-dimentional data are data with features (p) a lot more than observations (n). This types of data are very commonly generated from high-throuput sequencing experiments. For example, an RNA-seq or microarry experiment measures expression of tens of thousands of genes for only 8 samples (4 controls and 4 treatments).
Let’s use a microarray data for demonstration.</description>

      <description>featureCounts is a program to fast summarize counts from sequencing data. I use it to get gene-level RNAseq counts by
featureCounts -p -t exon -g gene_id -a annotation.gtf -o mysample_featureCount.txt mapping_results_PE.bam
If you have a lot of samples, you will get a lot of *featureCount.txt and you will need to merge them for downstream analysis.
I will show you how to merge the tables using R, python and unix below.</description>

1. The devil 1 and 0 coordinate system read detail here https://github.com/crazyhottommy/DNA-seq-analysis#tips-and-lessons-learned-during-my-dna-seq-data-analysis-journey
some files such as bed file is 0 based. Two genomic regions:
chr1 0 1000 chr1 1001 2000  when you import that bed file into R using rtracklayer::import(), it will become
chr1 1 1000 chr1 1002 2000  The function convert it to 1 based internally (R is 1 based unlike python).</description>
