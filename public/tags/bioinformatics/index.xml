      <title>How to create pseudobulk from single-cell RNAseq data </title>

      <guid>/post/how-to-create-pseudobulk-from-single-cell-rnaseq-data/</guid>
      <description>What is pseduobulk? Many of you have heard about bulk-RNAseq data. What is pseduobulk?
Single-cell RNAseq can profile the gene expression at single-cell resolution. For differential expression, psedobulk seems to perform really well(see paper muscat detects subpopulation-specific state transitions from multi-sample multi-condition single-cell transcriptomics data). To create a pseudobulk, one can artificially add up the counts for cells from the same cell type of the same sample.
In this blog post, I’ll guide you through the art of creating pseudobulk data from scRNA-seq experiments.</description>

      <description>In the mysterious world of DNA, where the secrets of life are encoded, scientists are harnessing the power of cutting-edge technology to decipher the language of genes. One of the remarkable tools they’re using is the 1D Convolutionary Neural Network, or 1D CNN, which might sound like jargon from a sci-fi movie, but it’s actually a game-changer in DNA sequence analysis.
Imagine DNA as a long, intricate string of letters, like a never-ending alphabet book.</description>

      <description>Multi-omics data analysis is a cutting-edge approach in biology that involves studying and integrating information from multiple biological “omics” sources. These omics sources include genomics (genes and their variations), transcriptomics (gene expression and RNA data), proteomics (proteins and their interactions), metabolomics (small molecules and metabolites), epigenomics (epigenetic modifications), and more. By analyzing data from various omics levels together, we can gain a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of biological systems and their complexities.</description>

      <description>Introductioon In scRNA-seq data analysis, one of the most crucial and demanding tasks is determining the optimal resolution and cluster number. Achieving an appropriate balance between over-clustering and under-clustering is often intricate, as it directly impacts the identification of distinct cell populations and biological insights.
The clustering algorithms have many parameters to tune and it can generate more clusters if e.g., you increase the resolution parameter. However, whether the newly generated clusters are meaningful or not is a question.</description>

      <description>What’s the drug development process? Has AI changed the course of Drug Development? To answer this question, we need first to understand the drug development process.
The whole process includes the following:
 target identification target pharmacology and biomarker development lead identification, lead optimization Clinical research &amp;amp; development regulatory review of IND (investigational new drug) and later phase clinical trials post-marketing knowledge  Biologics/antibodies drug development follows a similar path (you can find the map in the same link).</description>

      <description>introduce ggside using single cell data The ggside R package provides a new way to visualize data by combining the flexibility of ggplot2 with the power of side-by-side plots.
We will use a single cell dataset to demonstrate its usage.
ggside allows users to create side-by-side plots of multiple variables, such as gene expression, cell type, and experimental conditions. This can be helpful for identifying patterns and trends in scRNA-seq data that would be difficult to see in individual plots.</description>

Single-cell spatial transcriptome data is a new and advanced technology that combines the study of individual cells’ genes and their location in a tissue to understand the complex cellular and molecular differences within it. This allows scientists to investigate how genes are expressed and how cells interact with each other with much greater detail than before.</description>

The T-cell receptor (TCR) is a special molecule found on the surface of a type of immune cell called a T-cell. Think of T-cells like soldiers in your body’s defense system that help identify and attack foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria.
The TCR is like a sensor or antenna that allows T-cells to recognize specific targets, kind of like how a key fits into a lock.</description>

 The problem Let me be clear, when you have gazillions of data points in a scatter plot, you want to deal with the overplotting to avoid drawing misleading conclusions.
Let’s start with a single-cell example.
Load the libraries:

      <description>Are protein and RNA levels correlated? This is a big question.
see replies to this tweet at https://twitter.com/slavov_n/status/1561844133496512512. In general, RNA and protein abundances should be correlated but there are exceptions of course. Biology is complicated/weird!
 One of my favorite examples is Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha, HIF-1α. The protein is efficiently degraded in most tissues most of the time unless stabilized by hypoxia.</description>

This blog post will explore the tree based method: random forest and boost trees (gradient boost tree/XGboost). I highly recommend going through https://app.learney.me/maps/StatQuest for related sections by Josh Starmer. Note, all the tree based methods can be used to do both classification and regression.</description>

      <description>The CIMAC-CIDC Network is an NCI Cancer Moonshot initiative that provides cutting-edge technology and expertise in genomic, proteomic, and functional molecular analysis to enhance clinical trials in cancer immune therapies.
The four Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Centers (CIMACs) are at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Stanford University, MD Anderson, and Mount Sinai.
I am now leading the bioinformatics effort in the Cancer Immunologic Data Commons(CIDC) as part of the NCI Cancer Moonshot project on cancer immunotherapy.</description>
