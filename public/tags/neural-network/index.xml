      <description>Step 1, get a high-level understanding  Watch statquest by Josh Starmer.       1blue3brown deep learning playlist       Step2, code it out! If you are into python, watch “The spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation: building micrograd”:
    I still code in R for most of the time, so I walk through the R code in the deep learning with R book.</description>

      <description>Imagine you have a bunch of pictures of cats, and you want to find a way to generate new cat pictures that look similar to the ones you have. A variation autoencoder (VAE) is like a magical tool for creating these new cat pictures.
Here’s how it works:
Encoder: The VAE first takes your cat pictures and passes them through an encoder. This encoder is like a detective that tries to capture the important features of the cats, such as their fur color, size, and shape.</description>
