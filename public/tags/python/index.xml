      <description>To not miss a post like this, sign up for my newsletter to learn computational biology and bioinformatics.
The problem df&amp;lt;- data.frame(id = c(1,2,3), value = c(&amp;#39;x,y&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;z,w&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;a&amp;#39;)) df #&amp;gt; id value #&amp;gt; 1 1 x,y #&amp;gt; 2 2 z,w #&amp;gt; 3 3 a we want to put x,y in the first row into two rows:
1, x
1, y
and put z,w into two rows too.
 solution with R There is a neat function separate_rows that does exactly this in tidyr package:</description>

      <description>What does it do? For single cell ATACseq experiment, one gets a merged bam file for all cells. After going through clustering, one groups similar cells into cell types (cell states). This workflow will split the bam by clusters to create a pseudo bulk bam for each cluster, create bigwig tracks for visulization, call peaks for each cluster and merge the peaks across the clusters. Finally it will count reads per peak per cell from the original bam file on the merged peaks.</description>

      <description>I need a transcript to gene mapping file for Salmon. I am aware of annotation bioconductor packages that can do this job. However, I was working on a species which does not have the annotation in a package format (I am going to use Drosphila as an example for this blog post). I had to go and got the gtf file and made such a file from scratch.
Please read the specifications of those two file formats.</description>
