In the last blog post, I showed you how to use salmon to get counts from fastq files downloaded from GEO. In this post, I am going to show you how to read in the .sf salmon quantification file into R; how to get the tx2gene.txt file and do DESeq2 for differential gene expression analysis. Letâ€™s dive in!
library(tximport) library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) files&amp;lt;- list.</description>

      <description>Install fastq-dl To easily download fastq from GEO or ENA, use fastq-dl
Assume you already have conda installed, do the following:
conda config --add channels conda-forge conda config --add channels bioconda conda create -n fastq_download -c conda-forge -c bioconda fastq-dl conda activate fastq_download  Tip: use mamba if conda is too slow for you. They are all big snakes!!
We will use bulk RNAseq data from this GEO accession ID: https://www.</description>

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project is probably one of the most well-known large-scale cancer sequencing project. It sequenced ~10,000 treatment-naive tumors across 33 cancer types. Different data including whole-exome, whole-genome, copy-number (SNP array), bulk RNAseq, protein expression (Reverse-Phase Protein Array), DNA methylation are available.
TCGA is a very successful large sequencing project. I highly recommend learning from the organization of it.</description>
