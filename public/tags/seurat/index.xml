      <description>Introductioon In scRNA-seq data analysis, one of the most crucial and demanding tasks is determining the optimal resolution and cluster number. Achieving an appropriate balance between over-clustering and under-clustering is often intricate, as it directly impacts the identification of distinct cell populations and biological insights.
The clustering algorithms have many parameters to tune and it can generate more clusters if e.g., you increase the resolution parameter. However, whether the newly generated clusters are meaningful or not is a question.</description>

      <description>Download the data https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE116256
cd data/GSE116256 wget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE116nnn/GSE116256/suppl/GSE116256_RAW.tar tar xvf GSE116256_RAW.tar rm GSE116256_RAW.tar Depending on how the authors upload their data.
Some authors may just upload the merged count matrix file. This is the easiest situation.
In this dataset, each sample has a separate set of matrix (*dem.txt.gz), features and barcodes.
Total, there are 43 samples. For each sample, it has an associated metadata file (*anno.txt.gz) too.
You can inspect the files in command line:</description>

      <title>use random forest and boost trees to find marker genes in scRNAseq data</title>

      <description>This is a blog post for a series of posts on marker gene identification using machine learning methods. Read the previous posts: logistic regression and partial least square regression.
This blog post will explore the tree based method: random forest and boost trees (gradient boost tree/XGboost). I highly recommend going through https://app.learney.me/maps/StatQuest for related sections by Josh Starmer. Note, all the tree based methods can be used to do both classification and regression.</description>

      <title>customize FeaturePlot in Seurat for multi-condition comparisons using patchwork</title>

      <description>Seurat is great for scRNAseq analysis and it provides many easy-to-use ggplot2 wrappers for visualization. However, this brings the cost of flexibility. For example, In FeaturePlot, one can specify multiple genes and also split.by to further split to multiple the conditions in the meta.data. If split.by is not NULL, the ncol is ignored so you can not arrange the grid.
This is best to understand with an example.
library(dplyr) library(Seurat) library(patchwork) library(ggplot2) # Load the PBMC dataset pbmc.</description>
