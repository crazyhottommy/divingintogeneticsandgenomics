      <description>Context and Problem In scRNA-seq, each cell is sequenced individually, allowing for the analysis of gene expression at the single-cell level. This provides a wealth of information about the cellular identities and states. However, the high dimensionality of the data (thousands of genes) and the technical noise in the data can lead to challenges in accurately clustering the cells. Over-clustering is one such challenge, where cells that are biologically similar are clustered into distinct clusters.</description>

      <title>Do you really understand log2Fold change in single-cell RNAseq data?</title>

      <description>In Single-cell RNAseq analysis, there is a step to find the marker genes for each cluster. The output from Seurat FindAllMarkers has a column called avg_log2FC. It is the gene expression log2 fold change between cluster x and all other clusters.
How is that calculated? In this tweet thread by Lior Pachter, he said that there was a discrepancy for the logFC changes between Seurat and Scanpy: Actually, both Scanpy and Seurat calculate it wrong.</description>

      <title>How to make a multi-group dotplot for single-cell RNAseq data</title>

      <description>Dotplots are very popular for visualizing single-cell RNAseq data. In essence, the dot size represents the percentage of cells that are positive for that gene; the color intensity represents the average gene expression of that gene in a cell type.
It is easy to plot one using Seurat::dotplot or Sccustomize::clustered_dotplot. However, when you have multiple groups/conditions in your data and you want to visualize it by groups, it is not that straightforward.</description>

      <title>How to create pseudobulk from single-cell RNAseq data </title>
      <link>/post/how-to-create-pseudobulk-from-single-cell-rnaseq-data/</link>

      <guid>/post/how-to-create-pseudobulk-from-single-cell-rnaseq-data/</guid>
      <description>What is pseduobulk? Many of you have heard about bulk-RNAseq data. What is pseduobulk?
Single-cell RNAseq can profile the gene expression at single-cell resolution. For differential expression, psedobulk seems to perform really well(see paper muscat detects subpopulation-specific state transitions from multi-sample multi-condition single-cell transcriptomics data). To create a pseudobulk, one can artificially add up the counts for cells from the same cell type of the same sample.
In this blog post, I’ll guide you through the art of creating pseudobulk data from scRNA-seq experiments.</description>

      <description>Download the data https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE116256
cd data/GSE116256 wget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE116nnn/GSE116256/suppl/GSE116256_RAW.tar tar xvf GSE116256_RAW.tar rm GSE116256_RAW.tar Depending on how the authors upload their data.
Some authors may just upload the merged count matrix file. This is the easiest situation.
In this dataset, each sample has a separate set of matrix (*dem.txt.gz), features and barcodes.
Total, there are 43 samples. For each sample, it has an associated metadata file (*anno.txt.gz) too.
You can inspect the files in command line:</description>

      <description>introduce ggside using single cell data The ggside R package provides a new way to visualize data by combining the flexibility of ggplot2 with the power of side-by-side plots.
We will use a single cell dataset to demonstrate its usage.
ggside allows users to create side-by-side plots of multiple variables, such as gene expression, cell type, and experimental conditions. This can be helpful for identifying patterns and trends in scRNA-seq data that would be difficult to see in individual plots.</description>

      <description>Sign up for my newsletter to not miss a post like this https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.ck.page/newsletter
Single-cell spatial transcriptome data is a new and advanced technology that combines the study of individual cells’ genes and their location in a tissue to understand the complex cellular and molecular differences within it. This allows scientists to investigate how genes are expressed and how cells interact with each other with much greater detail than before.</description>

      <description>In my last blog post, I showed that pearson gene correlation for single-cell data has flaws because of the sparsity of the count matrix.
One way to get around it is to use the so called meta-cell. One can use KNN to find the K nearest neighbors and collapse them into a meta-cell. You can implement it from scratch, but one should not re-invent the wheel. For example, you can use metacells.</description>

      <description>This is an extension of my last blog post marker gene selection using logistic regression and regularization for scRNAseq.
Let’s use the same PBMC single-cell RNAseq data as an example.

# Load the PBMC dataset pbmc.data &amp;lt;- Read10X(data.dir = &amp;quot;~/blog_data/filtered_gene_bc_matrices/hg19/&amp;quot;) # Initialize the Seurat object with the raw (non-normalized data). pbmc &amp;lt;- CreateSeuratObject(counts = pbmc.data, project = &amp;quot;pbmc3k&amp;quot;, min.</description>

      <description>why this blog post? I saw a biorxiv paper titled A comparison of marker gene selection methods for single-cell RNA sequencing data
 Our results highlight the efficacy of simple methods, especially the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Student’s t-test and logistic regression
 I am interested in using logistic regression to find marker genes and want to try fitting the model in the tidymodel ecosystem and using different regularization methods.</description>

      <description>I am interested in learning more on matrix factorization and its application in scRNAseq data. I want to shout out to this paper: Enter the Matrix: Factorization Uncovers Knowledge from Omics by Elana J. Fertig group.
A matrix is decomposed to two matrices: the amplitude matrix and the pattern matrix. You can then do all sorts of things with the decomposed matrices. Single cell matrix is no special, one can use the matrix factorization techniques to derive interesting biological insights.</description>

      <description>scATACseq data are very sparse. It is sparser than scRNAseq. To do clustering of scATACseq data, there are some preprocessing steps need to be done.
I want to reproduce what has been done after reading the method section of these two recent scATACseq paper:
A Single-Cell Atlas of In Vivo Mammalian Chromatin Accessibility Darren et.al Cell 2018   Latent Semantic Indexing Cluster Analysis  In order to get an initial sense of the relationship between individual cells, we first broke the genome into 5kb windows and then scored each cell for any insertions in these windows, generating a large, sparse, binary matrix of 5kb windows by cells for each tissue.</description>

      <description>This post was inspired by Andrew Hill’s recent blog post.
Inspired by some nice posts by @timoast and @tangming2005 and work from @10xGenomics. Would still definitely have to split BAM files for other tasks, so easy to use tools for that are super useful too!
&amp;mdash; Andrew J Hill (@ahill_tweets) April 13, 2019  Andrew wrote that blog post in light of my other recent blog post and Tim’s (developer of the almighty Seurat package) blog post.</description>

      <guid>/post/split-a-10xscatac-bam-file-by-cluster/</guid>
      <description>I want to split the PBMC scATAC bam from 10x by cluster id. So, I can then make a bigwig for each cluster to visualize in IGV.
The first thing I did was googling to see if anyone has written such a tool (Do not reinvent the wheels!). People have done that because I saw figures from the scATAC papers. I just could not find it. Maybe I need to refine my googling skills.</description>
