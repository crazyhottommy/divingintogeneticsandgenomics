      <description>I asked this question on Twitter:
 what test to test if two distributions are different? I am aware of KS test. When n is large (which is common in genomic studies), the p-value is always significant. better to test against an effect size? how to do it in this context?
 In genomics studies, it is very common to have large N (e.g., the number of introns, promoters in the genome, number of cells in the single-cell studies).</description>

      <description>I asked this question on twitter.
load the package library(tidyverse)  make some dummy data The dummy example: We have two groups of samples: disease and health. We treat those cells in vitro with different dosages (0, 1, 5) of a chemical X and count the cell number after 3 hours.

      <description>I was reading Feature Selection and Dimension Reduction for Single Cell RNA-Seq based on a Multinomial Model. In the paper, the authors model the scRNAseq counts using a multinomial distribution.
I was using negative binomial distribution for modeling in my last post, so I asked the question on twitter:
for modeling RNAseq counts, what&#39;s the difference/advantages using negative binomial and multinomial distribution? â€” Ming Tang (@tangming2005) November 26, 2019   some quotes from the answers I get from Matthew</description>
