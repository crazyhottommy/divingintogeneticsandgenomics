In my last blog post, I talked about some common bioinformatics mistakes.
Today, we are going to talk about THE MOST common bioinformatics mistake people make. And I think it deserves a separate post about it. Even some experienced programmers get it wrong and the mistake prevails in many bioinformatics software:
The one-off mistake!</description>

This post is inspired by this popular thread in https://www.biostars.org/.
Common mistakes in general  Off-by-One Errors:  Mistakes occur when switching between different indexing systems. For example, BED files are 0-based while GFF/GTF files are 1-based, leading to potential misinterpretations of genomic coordinates.   This is one of the most common mistakes!</description>

The other day, I saw this tweet:
Machine learning and bioinformatics tutorials these days pic.twitter.com/0FhWWG09TB â€” Ramon Massoni Badosa (@rmassonix) May 15, 2024   Many of the bioinformatics tutorials are like that. I am not saying the tutorial is not good. For beginners, we need something basic first to understand it.</description>

      <title>How to make a transcript to gene mapping file</title>

      <description>I need a transcript to gene mapping file for Salmon. I am aware of annotation bioconductor packages that can do this job. However, I was working on a species which does not have the annotation in a package format (I am going to use Drosphila as an example for this blog post). I had to go and got the gtf file and made such a file from scratch.
Please read the specifications of those two file formats.</description>
